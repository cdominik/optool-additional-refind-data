The original data is in the Data directory.

$ ./convert.pl Data/*.txt

    produced the files in the Axis_Specific directory

$ source ./mix

   then produced the files in this directory, but with the comment
section still at the end.  It needs to be moved to the front, the Axis
fild need to be edited so that it contains the statement "1:2 mix of
Epara and Eperp".  Also the part about E in the first line needs to be
removed.  I did these final steps by hand.
